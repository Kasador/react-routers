## Why I Learn React?

I love how dynamic React is and how it helps, us developers, make fewer HTTP requests. This allows us to really speed up how fast our web applications can load and how well they perform.

### Learning React Routers

Learning React Routers has really changed the way I go about using and developing in React. This always me to render mulituple components without making HTTP requests every time the user wants to change pages.<br>

Like, for an example, instead of making a seperate page for the About section. I can make an about component and have it loaded when the user first visits the webpage. When user goes about clicking on it, instead of making an HTTP request, it will render "said component".

### Learning JSON with `fetch()`

The `fetch()` method makes it super easy to pull data from a JSON or XML file. Learning JSON and how to use API's is very important to me as this allows me to update webpages without having the user refresh the whole page. I'm all about making things dynamic!

### What I'm Still Learning?

I'm still having some troubles understanding React Hooks. This is a newer and more effective way of updating states and components in React.<br>

I will still continue learning React as I've fallen in love with the ecosystem and how thinks develop and change flawlessly. I'm truly in-love. Haha.
